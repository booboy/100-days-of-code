# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Brendan McDevitt]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Made a script that generates pub / priv key pairs in python. Researched
pycrypto. learned it was out of date, found pycryptdome and also learned about
cryptography library. found good resource: [intro to encryption](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2016/05/18/python-3-an-intro-to-encryption/)

### R1D2
Programmed a bunch while at work. Post work challenge: Program a discord
chatbot to mess with my friends. Began initial skeleton construction of this 
Things that need further digging on:
- looked up differences between @staticmethod vs @classmethod, going to focus
more on finding examples of these on forums and stackedoverflow
- [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) learning about
  asynchronous programming is the way that many applications function, and the
  discordpy library is mainly built with coroutines 
- coroutines `` wiki courtines | less``
