# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Brendan McDevitt]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Made a script that generates pub / priv key pairs in python. Researched
pycrypto. learned it was out of date, found pycryptdome and also learned about
cryptography library. found good resource: [intro to encryption](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2016/05/18/python-3-an-intro-to-encryption/)

### R1D2
Programmed a bunch while at work. Post work challenge: Program a discord
chatbot to mess with my friends. Began initial skeleton construction of this 
Things that need further digging on:
- looked up differences between @staticmethod vs @classmethod, going to focus
more on finding examples of these on forums and stackedoverflow
- [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) learning about
  asynchronous programming is the way that many applications function, and the
  discordpy library is mainly built with coroutines 
- coroutines `` wiki courtines | less``


### R1D3 
Not too much programming done, but I still managed to do 1 hours worth. I
wrote a unit test after following a tutorial that I found online for a function
for a project that I am working on. I know I wanted to make this 100 days of
code challenge exclusively separated from work stuff, but it is OK for now in
the beginning stages. My speed at programming will improve as I get better and
better. The tutorial video that I used can be found here: 
[Unit Testing Your Code with the unittest Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI)


### R1D4
Did some more programming while at work on unit testing things more. I also
looked more at the discordpy library example bots and copied those into my
project in a separate 'examples' directory. I think I am going to have to and
read alot more on asyncio and the concepts that come with it, so I am going to
spend some time tonight reading up on this more.


### R1D5
Did not feel like working on discord bot, so I just did some hacker rank
problems today. Nothing exciting just string validator stuff. I learned about
the any() function in python though which is a cool way to do some string
validation

### R1D6
Made an object that I can build on top of for nmap scripting in python. Spent a
good chunk just looking up how to use python-nmap and testing out scans in
ipython with the object.
